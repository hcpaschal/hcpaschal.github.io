		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello! I'm Holden Paschal, a passionate 29-year-old CIS graduate based in the beautiful city of Denver, Colorado. I am on an exciting journey to kickstart my career in the dynamic field of Information Technology.</p>

		<h2>Professional Aspirations</h2>
		<p>With a foundation in Computer Information Systems, I am eager to dive into the world of IT, starting with a focus on user support. My goal is to provide excellent service to users while troubleshooting their technical issues. As I embark on this journey, my sights are set on growing into a networking role, leveraging my technical skills and enthusiasm for building robust IT infrastructures.</p>

		<h2>Ceritifications in Progress</h2>
		<p>I currently hold CompTIA's A+ and Network+ certifications and am actively pursuing additional credentials to enhance my skill set. My roadmap includes obtaining CompTIA's Security+ and Cisco's CCNA certifications to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity and networking.</p>

		<h2>Why IT?</h2>
		<p>I am drawn to IT not just as a career but as a lifestyleâ€”a dynamic, ever-evolving field that aligns with my curiosity and problem-solving mindset. I believe that technology has the power to transform lives and drive innovation, and I'm excited to be a part of that journey.</p>

		<p>Join me as I navigate the world of IT, share my experiences, and showcase my skills and projects on this portfolio. Let's connect, collaborate, and build a future where technology makes a positive impact on the world</p>

		<h2>Beyond IT</h2>
		<p>Outside the realm of technology, you'll find me exploring some of my hobbies. I'm an avid gamer, movie enthusiast, and love spending time outdoors engaging in activities like camping and skateboarding. As a Colorado resident, I'm eager to get back into the winter scene and purchase a snowboard!</p>
